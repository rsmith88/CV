## Your Name

I am a Canadian lawyer who was given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to spend a year in London. Aside from traveling, one of my goals for the year was to develop a tangeable skillset that would open doors for me beyond traditional legal practice. After discovering Makers Academy, and trying a few online coding challenges, I knew that coding was not only a door-opener, but something I could be truly passionate about. 

[Specific interests within coding / skillset to be added during the course]

## Skills

#### Analysis & Problem Solving

I consider my analytical and problem solving abilities to be some of my greatest strengths. As a civil litigator, I used these skills daily to build cases for my clients. This, at the highest level, involved applying the information provided by clients to the appropriate legal frameworks, and using thoughtfulness and creativity to put forward the best possible case. 

These skills have translated well to code. I am quick to learn new concepts, and I am comfortable applying them to problems and challenges. I am also thoughtful in my approach to writing code, making best efforts to think through problems in their entirety prior to starting any code. 

#### Community Involvement & Mentorship

During the course of my legal career, I volunteered with several legal organizations, including serving on the board of the Vancouver Bar Association for two years. I also formally and informally mentored law students, articled students and new lawyers. Mentoring young lawyers was perhaps the most rewarding aspect of my career.

I am eager to apply this mentality of helping others to the next organization I join, and to the tech community more generally.
